# HDC-MNIST-FHRR-Classification

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook code for a Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) experiment focusing on MNIST digit classification. The project specifically implements **Fourier Holographic Reduced Representations (FHRR)** for encoding and explores two distinct learning paradigms:

1.  **Single-Pass Fit:** A highly efficient method for initial class hypervector generation by bundling encoded training data.
2.  **Iterative Learning:** An adaptive approach that refines class hypervectors over multiple epochs by reinforcing correct classifications and correcting misclassifications.

## Project Overview

This project provides a practical example of applying brain-inspired computing principles to a classic machine learning task. It showcases how high-dimensional vectors (hypervectors) can represent and process information for classification.

## Key Features

* Implementation of FHRR encoding for real-valued data (MNIST images).
* Functions for core HDC operations (similarity measurement, basis generation, feature encoding).
* Demonstration of MNIST classification using a single-pass associative memory, ideal for quick initial models.
* An iterative learning loop to incrementally improve model accuracy by adjusting class hypervectors based on classification errors.
* Visualization of classification results, including accuracy plots over epochs and confusion matrices, to assess model performance.
